# Car Price Prediction Project (Web Scraping → ML → Streamlit)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **real-world car price prediction system** using **real market data** scraped from multiple websites.

The goal is to: <br/>
- Collect **real car prices** from online sources.  
- Analyse and clean the data.
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict car prices.  
- Deploy the final solution as an **interactive Streamlit app**. <br/>

This project follows an **end-to-end data science workflow**, from data collection to deployment.

## Workflow
1. **Web Scraping**
- Extract car prices and features such as:
   - Brand
   - Model
   - Year
   - Mileage
   - Fuel type
   - Transmission
   - Location
   - Price

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values  
   - Remove duplicates  
   - Normalise and format variables  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Price distribution analysis  
   - Feature correlations  
   - Market trends and insights  

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Creating new meaningful features  
   - Feature selection  

5. **Machine Learning**
   - Train multiple models (e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
   - Model evaluation using appropriate metrics  
   - Hyperparameter tuning  

6. **Deployment**
   - Build an interactive **Streamlit app**  
   - Users can input car features and get a predicted price
